# FluentConf 2016 - Building Our Reactive Future

## Abstract

We hear a lot about reactive programming, but what is it? No, it doesn’t mean the Reactive Manifesto, and it’s not related to Facebook’s React. It’s simply a programming paradigm that is readily responsive to events, nothing more. In the JavaScript world, reactive programming is a way of life. As we build larger applications, event-driven reactive architectures become a mess of events passing and state management that is hard to reason with. Matthew Podwysocki explores how to embrace reactive programming and offers patterns for building better systems. Along the way, he explains how to handle state management, how to avoid race conditions between events, how to handle errors, and how to recover from errors and retry. You’ll leave knowing how reactive programming patterns can help build more robust applications.
